1)Please keep training videos in the same folder and name them "video_<No>.avi"
Currently, my train data set contains the following 6 ASLAN videos in 100 clusters:
7-0003.avi; 7-0049.avi; 7-0134.avi; 7-0237.avi; 7-0725.avi; 7-2773.avi; 7-3218.avi; 7-3305.avi
2)For Running this program, please execute command 'make' in the terminal for this directory.
It will compile the HW3.cpp file.
e.g:
$make HW3
3)Then run the executive file providing three argument- name and path for the two video files
Please do remember to input the filename "model01.obj" first and then the "commands01.txt" in sequence as command line arguments.
e.g
$./HW3 /path/input1.avi /path/input2.avi

4)The program will generate Similarity.txt file containing the similarity score as output in the current directory.
