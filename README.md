Computer Vision course assignments and projects


#Object Detection

--Implemented object detection system using Bag of Words Approach to detect objects in the ASLAN video dataset

--Performed feature extraction using SIFT descriptors, classification using K-means algorithm and derived similarity results using different image matching techniques like Correlation and Principal Component Analysis (OpenCV Libraries, C++)

#Ray Tracer

--Created a recursive ray tracer with sensor, lighting and object models (C++)

--The scene was modeled with geometric transformations, perspective transformations, perspective projections, 2D rasterization, illumination, surface reflectance, shadows, inter reflections and refraction

#Robot Motion Planner

--Implemented a robot motion planner to trace the end effector trajectory of a 6 axis planar robot through a given path (C++)

--Used object modeling, transformations, interpolation, SVD, kinematics and Singularities to move the robot
